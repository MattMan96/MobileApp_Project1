I, your customer, require an Android Mobile Application that I can use as a Professor at a University to gather information on my class full of strangers at the beginning of each semester.  I will need to be able to quickly type in information as students introduce themselves, OR pass the device around the room and have students enter their own info.
I need to capture the following data:
Name
Major
Where they are From
Gender
Picture
Notes (free-form data like "What did you do over the summer?")
This data needs to persist.  Somewhere.  I just need to be able to access it later if needed.  Could be stored on device, in that "Cloud" thingie (I think you can buy Cloud on Amazon?), or just some majic black-box.
I also need to be able to sort and filter the data.  Like, if I wanted to see what percentage of students were CS Majors.  Or how many females we had in class.  Or how many people in class were NOT from Texas (there should be a FEW, right?).
Oh, and the pictures we have on Canvas don't really look like the students do NOW.  So I'd like current photos.  
 

 

From the Technical Adviser/Manager:
Wow.  Those requirements are a little... vague?  Your job is to gather as a team and figure out how we are going to make an app that meets the rough requirements and makes the customer happy.  If you think of something the cusrtomer missed, let us know.  Also, any "WOW Factor" ideas that you have that can take this project to the next level are encouraged.  You will present, AS A TEAM, your project proposals THIS FRIDAY in class.  Make sure the customer understands what you are givinbg them, how you are meeting their needs, and POINT OUT where you have augmented their great ideas with something additional or extra!
